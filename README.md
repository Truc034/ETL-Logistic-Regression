# HR Analytics: Job Change of Data Scientists
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project aims to help a data-driven company identify which candidates are likely to seek a new job after completing the company's training program for data science. By predicting candidate behavior, the company can optimize training resources, reduce cost, and improve course planning and targeting.

## ðŸ“Š Data Source
Information related to demographics, education, experience are in hands from candidates signup and enrollment.
Total 6 data tables collected from various sources including an Excel file, a CSV file, a Google Sheet, a web page, and an SQL database.

### Table 1. Enrollies' data
As enrollies are submitting their request to join the course via Google Forms, we have the Google Sheet that stores data about enrolled students, containing the following columns:

`enrollee_id`: unique ID of an enrollee

`full_name`: full name of an enrollee

`city`: the name of an enrollie's city

`gender`: gender of an enrollee
